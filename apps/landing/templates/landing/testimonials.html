                <p>“I would strongly recommend any parent with little kids to go for an assessment with
                    Aptitude
                    World.<br><br>
                    Parenting is probably the most rewarding and at the same time challenging thing that
                    we do in
                    our life. I saw my little girls grow from tiny babies into little girls, but even
                    then I used to
                    feel that I don’t know them too well, questioning ‘Why are they behaving in this
                    way?’ ‘What are
                    their natural talents?’ ‘Am I doing the right thing?’ What would be the best way to
                    guide them?’
                    I wanted to be an effective parent. Aptitude World came along with a helping hand in
                    answering
                    all these questions for me.<br><br>
                    When the consultant explained to me about each of my daughters’ mental make-up, it
                    was a light
                    bulb moment for me and I felt that I understand them better now. I have seen myself
                    becoming
                    more patient and acceptable of them. In the last few months I have observed my
                    relationship with
                    my older daughter has improved considerably, there is less friction between us and
                    her
                    performance at school has also improved considerably. I found out through the report
                    that she
                    has a creative bent of mind so we want to encourage her in that direction as well.
                    I felt that the report was very accurate and even made some career recommendations
                    at the end
                    which is very handy. When the time comes I will be able to give proper guidance and
                    steer them
                    in the right direction.<br><br>
                    I think what these reports have done for us is that we know at the back of our mind
                    what we need
                    to encourage in our kids, our focus has shifted from their shortcomings to their
                    innate natural
                    talents which need to be stimulated.
                    Thank you Aptitude World.”</p>
