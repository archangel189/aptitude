                    <p>Should you have to cancel your assessment, you must notify us at least 24 hour in advance. The
                        deposit is not
                        refundable but transferrable once only. Once biometric data is taken, no cancellation of service
                        can be
                        made.</p>

                    <h4>Confidentiality</h4>

                    <p>Your personal data is treated with utmost privacy and confidentiality. Once the aptitude report
                        is generated, the
                        biometric data is automatically deleted from the system. Aptitude World is not able to recreate
                        or regenerate
                        biometric data for any purpose.</p>
