                    <h2>What is Aptitude World?</h2>

                    <p align="justify">
                        Aptitude World is the first in Australia to introduce an aptitude assessment program that is
                        non-evasive, no questionnaire involved, and can be done from 12 months of age.
                        We utilise the latest version of Dermatoglyphics Test to uncover the hidden talent of a child
                        with up to <b>95% accuracy</b>. It is a simple procedure of scanning the fingertips to generate
                        a
                        report that is unique and tailored to the child.
                        We are a community of parents and professionals who are all passionate about children
                        development and believe in utilising modern technology to assist us in grooming our children
                        to the best that they can be.
                        As a forward thinking organisation, Aptitude World takes the commitment to continue
                        developing learning technologies to enrich people globally. We believe in the power of sharing
                        knowledge and this philosophy will ultimately drive our organisation to greater heights.

                    <p>
                        While some of these problems are self inflicted, it is also caused by the rigid education system
                        and high social expectation.
                        The ultimate aim of Aptitude World is to provide inspirational guidance to parents in grooming
                        their child according to their inborn character and innate talents. The ideal learning
                        environment should not be stressful but stimulating, exciting and far away from the stress.

                    <h4>Left Brain People</h4>

                    <p>
                        Guided by the left brain, theories suggest that left-brain people respond in sequential, logical
                        ways and this group of people are strong in math and science, and can answer questions
                        quickly.
                        "Most people in modern world operate as left-brain people due to the education system in
                        school which focus on left brain training..."
                    </p>

                    <h4>Right Brain People</h4>

                    <p>
                        On the contrary, right-brain people are dreamers who are led
                        by intuition and creativity. Right brainers think deeply and may have high level of
                        intelligence. Right brainers make great students of arts and social science. Besides being
                        more spontaneous than the conservative left-brainers, right brainers are intuitive and prefer
                        to follow their own gut feelings when it comes to decision making.
