                    <h4>1st Approach: Understand your child's innate characteristic</h4>

                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            Parents often misunderstood their children simply because they do not know their inborn
                            characteristic (curious, aggressive, rebellious, persistent and etc.)
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            To understand and develop an effective way to interact with your child based on their inborn
                            communication style
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            For adults, this test can be used for self-evaluation and compatibility with your spouse or
                            business partner
                        </li>
                    </ul>

                         style="display: block; margin: 10px auto 10px auto;"/>

                    <h4>2nd Approach: Know your child's inborn learning style or ability</h4>

                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            To know exactly the natural learning style a child possess:
                            <ul>
                                <li>
                                    A <b>kinesthetic learner</b> is good in expressing their feeling/thought through
                                    body language and prefers to learn/memorise through operation and movement
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    A <b>visual learner</b> has sharp observation/visual differentiation and prefers to
                                    learn through observation and reading
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    An <b>auditory learner</b> prefers to learn through auditory sense/oral practice and
                                    able to assimilate, organise and arrange oral information.
                                </li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            To recommend parents to place their child in courses or pre-school where its curriculum
                            suits the child's inborn learning style (i.e. Kinesthetic learner learns best at Montessori
                            due to its activity-based method)
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            To eliminate the "trial and error" situation when parents send their child to a certain
                            class (i.e. art class or music class) without knowing if the child is capable to comprehend
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            For adults, this test will reveal to them the strength they possess and to guide them to
                            perform better at work
                        </li>
                    </ul>

                        <li><b>Every child</b> is unique and they possess different inborn talents</li>
                        <li>To use a scientifically proven method (up to 95% accuracy) to reveal a child's inborn
                            potential (strength and weakness)
                        </li>
                        <li>To give parents <b>an insight into their child</b> and to groom them effectively to the
                            talents they possess

                        <li>To enable parents to <b>focus on their child's strength and to eliminate the "guessing game"
                            on their talent</b></li>

                            university major that best suit their inborn abilities and potential
